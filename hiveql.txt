run this by starting vm in it cloudera and then in cloudera quick start terminal (above) run ll this commands.
enter given commands one by one:

~ hive

~ create database mydb2;

~ use mybd2;

~ create table flight(fno int, year int, dest varchar(10), delay float);

~ alter table flight rename to air_flight;

~ alter table air_flight add columns(source varchar(10));

~ drop table flight;

~ desc air_flight;

~ create table flight(fno int, year int, dest varchar(10), delay float)
> row format delimited
> fields terminated by ','
> lines terminated by '\n'
> stored as textfile;

~ insert into flight values(123, 2009, "mumbai", 30.6);
~ insert into flight values(124, 2008, "pune", 50.0);

~ select * from flight;

*** in vm again open new terminal and run code in gedit:*****

~ gedit f.txt
text file will be opened.
insert records in it:
923,2009,navi mumbai,60.0
156,2009,kolhapur,78.0
112,2009,pune,0.0
322,2008,nagpur,90.0

save and close file

back to gedit f.txt terminal

~ pwd

~ ls

go to hive terminal

~ load data local inpath "f.txt"
> overwrite into table flight;

~ select * from flight;

~ create table nflight(fno int, year int, source varchar(10))

> stored as textfile;

~ select * from flight;

~ insert into nflight values(923,2009, "pune");

~ select a.fno, a.year, a.dest, a.delay,b.source
> from flight a join nflight b
> on(a.fno=b.fno);

~ create index flight_index on table flight(fno)
